A responsive framework for Magento using the Skeleton 960 responsive grid system!
=========================

NB: this is a framework for you guys to dump into your existing themes and start making them responsive. It is NOT a theme.

As with all my stuff, it can probably be better, so send me a pull request.

Features:

- Adds the Skeleton grid as a layout in Magento instead of 1column.phtml or 2column-left.phtml etc
- You can add no-frame.phtml to any page via layout update
- â€¦even for CMS pages or category/product layout updates via the admin
- includes Paul Irish's html IE classes from HTML5 Boilerplate
- includes facebook compatibility (xml stuff in the html tag)
- includes <meta> tag to make responsive designs work

What's the story?
=========

I originally built this for <http://www.getbrandid.com> and then presented it for <http://magento.meetup.com>


Slides are here: <http://www.slideshare.net/arushsehgal/magento-x-codekit-x-skeleton-960-responsive-grid>


What is it?
================

- Modified base.css to include magento essentials
- skeleton.css
- layout.css

- no-frame.phtml
- config.xml
- Mage_All.xml (to tell Magento to use the local code pool for config.xml)


Please contribute - to do
========
- find a better way to add as a layout in the admin instead of overriding core file
- feature requests?
